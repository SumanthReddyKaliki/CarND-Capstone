* Requirement understanding

** Input
 - Input: /current_velocity
 - Input: /twist_cmd
 - input: /vehicle/dbw_enabled

/twist_cmd is the representation of the required the target linear and angular velocity.

** Output
 - Output: /vehicle/throttle_cmd
 - Output: /vehicle/steering_cmd
 - Output: /vehicle/brake_cmd

The requirement is to output the above commands so that the vehicle can drive correctly on the track,
based on its current speed, and the desired speed at the current waypoint, and the state of dbw_enabled.

*** dbw_mkz_msgs/ThrottleCmd

    Where can I find more information on how to program dbw_mkz_msgs/ThrottleCmd?

    In the provided source code of =dbw_node.py= there is a pubilsh method which encapsulates the code required to
    prepare proper messages of ThrottleCmd, SteeringCmd, and BrakeCmd. Therefore, there is no more need to answer the above question.

    It seems that the pedal_cmd_type may have the value of the following:
    - CMD_NONE=0
    - CMD_PEDAL=1
    - CMD_PERCENT=2

    while pedal_cmd may have the actual command value for the mode of CMD_PERCENT, for example, the percent value.
    I'm not sure what would be meaning of the value for pedal_cmd in the mode of CMD_PEDAL, or CMD_NONE. I guess for the mode of CMD_NONE, there is no value needed.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ rosmsg info dbw_mkz_msgs/ThrottleCmd
  uint8 CMD_NONE=0
  uint8 CMD_PEDAL=1
  uint8 CMD_PERCENT=2
  float32 pedal_cmd

How to program the values in the following fields?

- steering_wheel_angle_cmd might be the desired steering angle in radius
- steering_wheel_angle_velocity might be the velocity of the steering

how about the other fields?

* Architecture discussion

  Moving the processing of /current_pose message in Waypoint_Updater from a callback to a loop with 2Hz frequency made the car drive
  much longer distance before veering off the road.

  Did the same with the processing of curreent_velocity and desired_velocity in dbw_node, however make the car veer off to the right
  at the same spot, the sharp left turn after the second traffic light. Increasing the frequency from 2 to 10, recover the better driving
  as the time when only changing the processing of /current_pos message.

  This shows that the alignment and synchronization of message processing is crucial.

  The message should be processed as soon as possible but should not block the processing of the messages.

  It would be interesting to test if the frequency 10 can be further reduced.

  loop_frequency for dbw_node tested:
  - 15, seems better than 10, slightly, the best so far
  - 10, good
  - 7,  as good as 10, but not as good as 15
  - 5, better than 3, worse than 10
  -
  - 3, no good
  - 2, no good


* TwistController

  This is the core of the control logic to produce control parameters to control the vehicle based
  on the inputs of the current velocity, the desired velocity, and the state of dbw_enabled state.

  The rest of the code just provides the communication and execution infrastructure.


* Source Code Decomposition and Assembly

  It's my practice of understanding and building source code and explain to myself and other readers.

  I'd decompose the source code into code blocks and them assemble then in terms of such blocks.
  This helps me to focus on each block,
  while getting the whole picture of what the overall program is doing.

** Top level assembly

   This assembly shows the architecture of the source code.

   Experiment to try not using loop, but just control from twist_cmd_cb. It seems still working.
   As long as the control logic does not take too long, it should work.

   Also, experiment showed even using loop, the frequency can be reduced to 2Hz from 50Hz.
   This will significantly reduce the CPU load.

** twist_controller

Based on the current velocity, and the desired velocity in both linear and angular, compute their delta, then use PID to control.

There is a PID implementation, but the parameters of P, I, D needs to be determined. I'm guessing the parameters for now.

For the steering, it seems that the implementation of YawController can be used as is.

The lowpass filter is an average mechanism. I'm not where to use it. With the input of the inputs of
the current and the desired velocity, or the output of the throttle, steering, and brake?
I'm using to smooth the current linear velocity for now.

- 11/6 ::
Also need to implement the mechanism only process the latest message, to avoid stalled command. Callback should be simple.
The message processing should be regulated, only process the most recent one.

*** Some more leads on twist controller design

    Need to digest further the below info.

 Based on communication from the Slack channel #system-integration:
 #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   C S [2 months ago]
   @ddigges @wsteiner This worked for me: pass the yaw from twist_cmd through a low-pass filter and then into the provided YawController, except that when creating the YawController you need to multiply the provided steer_ratio by 8 or so.  And if you are want to go fast, you need to increase max_lat_accel accordingly.  In general, this gives a nice, non-nausea-inducing result.  The problem is that at high speeds, twist_cmd steers the way a racing car would, drifting into the inside lane in order to reduce lateral forces.  But it is, um, mostly ok at 40 mph.
 #+END_EXAMPLE

 Here is some discussion on the controller:

 #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   1, the unit transformation is automatically done by Udacity project default.
   2, the difference between current velocity and designed velocity should be input to PID and will output throttle as percent.  This is project default solution.  I give up pid control since it is not easy to tune for carla.
   3,  the brake default unit is Nm. you need calcuate it with: Brake torque = (vehicle_mass + fuel_capacity * GAS_DENSITY) * deceleration * wheel_radius

   https://github.com/xfqbuaa/Cargo-CarND-Capstone
 #+END_EXAMPLE
 It seems that for steering, no PID needed, but need to "multiply the provided steer_ratio by 8 or so".

 Here is another piece on the solution (https://discussions.udacity.com/t/solved-compute-cte-without-car-position/364383/6) :
 #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   That isn’t quite right. The CTE is the difference between the car’s actual position, and the position where the car should have been at that time. In other words, it is the distance between the car and the desired path. So to calculate the CTE, you need the car’s current position, and then you need to do a geometrical calculation to find the distance to the linear path interpolated along the waypoints.

   However, I have had success using a completely different approach. The twist_cmd topic is generated by a fancy piece of software called pure_pursuit, which is in the waypoint_follower directory. pure_pursuit uses the current car position, and the waypoints, to calculate the yaw angle that the car needs to follow in order to get onto, and to stay on, the desired path (the waypoint path). This yaw angle is published in the twist_cmd topic. Then another piece of software, twist_controller/yaw_controller.py, converts the yaw angle to a steering setting that you can send to the vehicle. No need for you to compute the CTE yourself, nor to write a PID controller.

   So you can do this in dbw_node.py: extract the yaw angle from twist_cmd, put it through a low-pass filter (because it may be a bit jittery), put that through yaw_controller, and publish the result (the steering value) in the “loop” section of dbw_node.py. But one thing to be aware of, that I learned through trial and error. When you set up YawController, you need to pass it several parameters that have been provided by Udacity. But the Udacity steer_ratio is too low; you need to multiply it by a factor of 8. But then it works pretty well.

   Note that this is just for steering control; you need to follow a different process (probably with a PID controller) to control the velocity. For testing, however, you can just publish a constant throttle value; 0.5 makes the car go about 40 mph, at least on my machine.

   Also: before you do anything else, search the Slack channel for everything by Alexey Makurin. His set of simple parameter changes: https://github.com/amakurin/CarND-Capstone/commit/9809bc60d51c06174f8c8bfe6c40c88ec1c39d5043 will improve the performance of your code immensely.

 You can build this node only after you have built (or partially built) the `waypoint_updater` node.

 You will subscribe to `/twist_cmd` message which provides the proposed linear and angular velocities.
 You can subscribe to any other message that you find important or refer to the document for list
 of messages subscribed to by the reference implementation of this node.

 One thing to keep in mind while building this node and the `twist_controller` class is the status
 of `dbw_enabled`. While in the simulator, its enabled all the time, in the real car, that will
 not be the case. This may cause your PID controller to accumulate error because the car could
 temporarily be driven by a human instead of your controller.

 We have provided two launch files with this node. Vehicle specific values (like vehicle_mass,
 wheel_base) etc should not be altered in these files.

 We have also provided some reference implementations for PID controller and other utility classes.
 You are free to use them or build your own.

 Once you have the proposed throttle, brake, and steer values, publish it on the various publishers
 that we have created in the `__init__` function.
